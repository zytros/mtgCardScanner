## What this folder is for
In order to precompute the visualizations for the website, we use this folder to save our progress. We start by investigating attribution visualization for the Swin Image Classification Transformer.

## ImageNet1k
From the ImageNet1000 dataset, which the Swin Classifier was trained on, we choose the following ten classes to focus our visualizaation computations on:
- two types of birds to see matching neuron activities over similar features
    - "n01614925": "bald eagle, American eagle, Haliaeetus leucocephalus",
    - "n01616318": "vulture",
- two types of wild cats to see matching neuron activities over similar features
    - "n02128385": "leopard, Panthera pardus",
    - "n02130308": "cheetah, chetah, Acinonyx jubatus",
- "n02280649": "cabbage butterfly",
- "n02317335": "starfish, sea star",
- "n02119022": "red fox, Vulpes vulpes",
- "n02123394": "Persian cat",
- "n02206856": "bee",
- "n02391049": "zebra",
